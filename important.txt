ok as of mar 30(?) menus and buttons are broken on all commands because of a discord issue

i can simply update the package version the bot is running on (not gonna get into nerdy stuff here) but the big problem is that some of you might know (it's ok if you don't know) my laptop is broken and i was borrowing my parent's laptop the past weeks but now they won't let m

so yeah you gotta play crumbseeker for now (i think) to find your costumes and stuff until i get my hands on he laptop again lol

ETA: as of 30/3: maybe today(?) to until weekend
